Description: Standardize the process of bringing various modes of output files
    into R. For more information, see:
    <https://actigraph.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2515800-what-do-the-different-mode-numbers-mean-in-a-csv-or-dat-file->.
    Additionally, processes are provided to read and minimally pre-
    process raw data from primary accelerometer and inertial measurement unit files,
    as well as binary .gt3x files. ActiGraph monitors are used to estimate physical
    activity outcomes via body-worn sensors that measure (e.g.) acceleration or
    rotational velocity.
