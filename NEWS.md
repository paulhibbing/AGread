# AGread 2.0.0

  The legacy parser has been dismantled because of its dependency on the
  `binaryLogic` package, which was archived in April 2022. This is a breaking
  change and thus reflected in a major version increment.
  
  Additionally, reintegration has been restructured with both available methods
  now available in a single `reintegrate` function

## Changes

  * Removed dependency on `binaryLogic` by dismantling legacy .gt3x parser
  * Updated the interface for reintegration

# AGread 1.2.0

  * Added reintegrate2
  * Added a `parser = "dev"` option for `read_gt3x`, which serves
    as a wrapper and formatter around `read.gt3x::read.gt3x`

## Changes

  * Fixed bugs related to overload and argument classes
  
  
# AGread 1.1.0

## Changes

  * Revised interpolation schemes where necessary to ensure
    matching output between `read_gt3x` and exported csv files
  * Resolved type mismatch in declaration/definition for
    IMU sensor parsing
  * Incorporated idle sleep mode assessment
  * Updated unit test cache
  * Utilized pre-allocation to speed up code (#15, @muschellij2)
  * Accounted for trailing zeroes in packets
  * Fixed column name detection in `read_AG_counts`


# AGread 1.0.0

## Summary

  Version 1.0.0 features speedup via Rcpp in the `read_gt3x`
  function. There is also increased reliance on S3 OOP
  in the background code. The output is now successfully
  tested for alignment with \*RAW.csv and \*-IMU.csv
  output, having accounted for several issues noted below.
      
## Changes

  * Revised the flow of `parse_log_bin` to handle packet sets
    via S3
  * Accounted for USB connections in `gt3x` files
  * Corrected the interpolation of over- or under-sampled
    IMU packets
  * Incorporated Rcpp to speed up `read_gt3x`
  * Deprecated `get_duration` in favor of the equivalent
    function in PAutilities
  * Revised unit tests to ensure equivalence between various
    reading methods (csv output vs gt3x output etc.)
  * Updated example data
